## About Me

I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Biostatistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>'s <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Grossman School of Medicine</a>, specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/thaddeus-tarpey" target="_blank"> Thaddeus Tarpey</a>, I'm actively engaged in developing advanced mathematical statistics methods for high-dimensional complex data including functional and imaging data.


Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my master's degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from <a href="https://gradschool.weill.cornell.edu" target = "_blank"> Weill Cornell Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://www.idiaz.xyz" target = "_blank"> Iván Díaz</a> at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target = "_blank"> Cornell University</a>, and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>. In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://about.google" target="_blank"> Google</a>, where I applied my statistical skills to real-world problems.
<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

 Outside of academia, I'm an accomplished swimmer, having started training at the age of 5 and winning several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a> 中国美术馆(北京).
